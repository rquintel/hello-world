# hello-world
My first Github repository

Hello, guys !!!
I'm Rodrigo and I'm studying Data Science on Coursera. I'm a Production/Civil Engineer and I'm passionate about programming and all computing stuff. I'm a former Accenture Senior Systems Analyst and I intend do shift my career once again by embracing a data scientist path. I wish I could get help here and help others to find their paths too.
Thank you and enjoy !!
